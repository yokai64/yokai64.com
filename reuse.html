          <h1>Video and text Content Re-use policy</h1>
          <h4>My personal stance on fair use and</h4>
          <h5>how I allow my content to be re-used</h5>
        </div>
        <hr />
        <h4>Not allowed</h4>
        <p>
          Unless explicitly stated otherwise, I <b><u>do not</u></b> give
          permission or allow for my:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            voice, face or any other part of me to be reconstructed, modified,
            manipulated or otherwise be used by AI or used in AI models.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I believe that AI is an affront to creative works and the human
          spirit. AI can be a tool for productivity, however I completely
          disagree with how it is currently being deployed - being used to
          replace animators, artists and even people not in those types of
          creative spaces such as software engineers etc.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>content to be used in a so-called "reaction" context.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As always, "Fair Use" clauses such as actual commentary is allowed,
          but just leaving videos playing during streams and going AFK or saying
          nothing except for the odd interjection is not ok. You know the types,
          and you know who you are.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>content to be downloaded for the purposes of re-distribution.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You may not download my works in order to reupload to other websites
          or host on other platforms, or re-distribute in any way.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h4>Permitted</h4>

        <p>
          Unless explicitly stated otherwise, I <b><u>allow</u></b> everyone to:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            download my content for the purposes of personal or small group
            offline viewing
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I understand that there are circumstances in which you have limited or
          no access to internet connectivity for a period of time, and you may
          want to watch my videos or other content but won't be able to. I am
          humbled that you want to watch my stuff to the point where you cache
          it to watch at a later time! Additionally, if you want to download to
          watch with friends or in a classroom (for example) I permit this.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            show or re-use clips of my content in "reaction" content for the
            purposes of valid criticism.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Yes, this is allowed as part of "Fair Use", if I understand it
          correctly. I understand that I'll probably get something wrong at some
          point. I would prefer if you reached out first before doing a public
          take-down, but I can't stop you if you decide to. I'm always open to
          feedback, so please take the private route before going scorched
          earth!
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            show or re-use clips from my content to reiterate a point in a video
            not solely related to my work.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Again - this is probably allowed by fair use, but if you wanna use
          clips from my videos to make a point or even as a joke go ahead.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            play my content on a stream - so long as it's not a straight rip.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You may play my videos on a stream if you wish, however: you must not
          sit there and say nothing (or otherwise add nothing to the content)
          for extended periods of time - see the "Not Allowed" section above.
        </p>
